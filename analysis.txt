Task0: O(1) constant time complexity because we're only accessing the first and last values from the list.

Task1:	O(n) linear time complexity because we're traversing through each element in the list.

Task2:	O(n) linear time complexity because we're traversing through each element in the list.

Task3:	O(n log n) linearithmic time complexity because we're using sorting(timsort).
 
Task4: O(n log n) linearithmic time complexity because we're using sorting(timsort).
